# "r" - Read - Default value. Opens a file for reading, error if the file does not exist

x = open("D:\PythonPracticeAgain\FileHandling\demofile.txt","r")


# To open a file for reading it is enough to specify the name of the file:
f = open("demofile.txt")


# The code above is the same as:
f = open("demofile.txt", "rt")
